# MiraiModConfig
A helper tool for the 3DS allowing multiple custom charts to be easily loaded into the 1925 slot and swapped between eachother. It is planned to support USA, EUR, and JPN regions of Mirai DX.

## Dev notes
layeredfs folder will be moved into romfs:/mirai/ eventually, however 6kb is a lot to be sending over 3dslink so its moved out for now.

## Other notes
I think it would be cool to inject some sort of ingame menu to swap without having to reload the game every time. Something similar to what CTGP-7 does.
